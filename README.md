MIPS-I Digital Logic
==================
The goal of this project is to make a (somewhat) accurate recreation of the digital logic used in the 1985 MIPS-I architecture, and create a full MIPS-I CPU. I am basing the all of the digital logic off of the instruction set for the architecture found at http://www.ece.umd.edu/~manoj/759M/MIPSALM.html

This repo will contain a .circ file which can be opened in Logisim (http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~burch/logisim/) in order to view the designs.

As of right now, I am working on the creation of individual instructions. This means that while parts of the CPU are getting completed, it will not function as a CPU until all of the instructions are completed and assembled.

This project CAN/WILL contain unoptimized and possibly redundant digital logic which may or may not be fixed at a later date. Since this is a homebrew design, I may or may not choose to include new instructions, or exclude instructions.

I'm doing this project solely to further my own understanding of microarchitecture and digital logic design and this is not meant to be useful to anyone else outside of educational purposes.
